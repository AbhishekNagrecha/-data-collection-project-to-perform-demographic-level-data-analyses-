# data-collection-project-to-perform-demographic-level-data-analyses
We propose a data collection project to perform demographic level data analyses which
provides a data driven solution to tackle the pandemic. Two major issues with data
collection using IoT or technology-based methods is the ability to track the data back to
the individual, thus comprising their privacy, as well as the collection of unwanted and
irrelevant data. We focus on three major ethical issues: privacy, transparency and
informed consent, and security. The data collection process is carried out by volunteers
who are provided with clear details of how and why the data collected is being used, thus
acquiring informed consent from general public. The data points are made abstract,
avoiding personal identification or misinformation ensuring privacy and security. The data
collected is then used for data analytics to predict future spread of the pandemic, or
suggest data-driven demographic level measures to contain the spread and help plan
optimal demographic level health care support.
